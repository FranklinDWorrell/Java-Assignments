## Description
This assignment required implementing a stack so as to convert infix notation to postfix notation. The stack is built on a singly linked list, which is also implemented here. The infix-to-postfix algorithm is implemented as a static method of StartUp.java, which contains a main method. JUnit test classes are provided for both the linked list and the stack.
