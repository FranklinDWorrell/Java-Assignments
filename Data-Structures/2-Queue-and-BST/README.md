## Description
Implementation of a queue built on a singly linked list--which is slightly modified from the version used for the stack in assignment 1. Additionally, a binary search tree with three different traversal strategies is implemented. JUnit test classes are implemented for Queue, BinaryTree, and BinarySearchTree. Startup contains a simply main method.
