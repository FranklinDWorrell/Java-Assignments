## Description
Three recursive static methods implemented in a single class. The first implements a compareTo method for Strings that uses alphabetical order as its natural ordering. The second finds the minimum String of an array of Strings based on the natural ordering implemented in the previous compareTo method. Finally, the third method recursively multiplies without using Java's multiplication operation. A JUnit test class is provided.
