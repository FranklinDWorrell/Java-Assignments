In Software Development 1 (CSCI 1581) the homeworks were oriented towards 
completing a single large project, a text-based adventure game. Each iteration 
added a level of complexity. This is the final iteration of my game, which is 
based on the work of H. P. Lovecraft. UML diagrams are included--this was part 
of the assignment as well.
